/**
 * Refusal messages, keyed by an opaque code.
 *
 * The banner in components/Notice.tsx is part of the hub's own trusted
 * chrome, so it must never render text an attacker can put in the URL. A
 * crafted link such as /profile?denied=Email+your+resume+to+attacker@x would
 * otherwise render as a hub instruction on an authenticated page. Actions
 * therefore pass a code and the copy lives here; an unrecognised code
 * renders nothing at all.
 *
 * Kept as a plain .ts module (no JSX) so it can be imported from
 * node-environment code -- lib/actions/deny.ts and the vitest suite in
 * tests/rls -- without dragging in a React component module.
