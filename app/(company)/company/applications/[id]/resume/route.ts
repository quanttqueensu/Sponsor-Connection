/**
 * Mints an applicant document URL on demand.
 *
 * The recruiter page used to embed a one-hour signed URL for every applicant's
 * resume and cover letter in its RSC payload. Those URLs carry no
 * authentication, so a forwarded link or a screenshot of the page source
 * handed anyone an hour of access to a student's resume. Nothing is signed
 * until someone actually clicks, the click is re-authorised here against the
 * caller's own company, and the URL that comes back lives ~90 seconds -- long
 * enough for the browser to follow the redirect, not long enough to pass on.
 * `download: true` forces Content-Disposition: attachment so a polyglot is
 * saved, not inlined as HTML if a browser sniffed the bytes.
 *
 * Layouts do not wrap route handlers, so every check the page's layout would
 * have made is repeated here explicitly.
